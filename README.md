I developed a Candy Crush-inspired game using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The game allows users to play an interactive tile-matching puzzle with real-time updates and a scoring system. The frontend, built with React.js, delivers a dynamic and engaging user interface, styled with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, manages user authentication, game logic, and leaderboard data, which is stored in MongoDB. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate interactive design with robust backend functionality, creating a seamless gaming experience
